 > Now Rann the Kite brings home the night
 >   That Mang the Bat sets free—
 > The herds are shut in byre and hut
 >   For loosed till dawn are we.
 > This is the hour of pride and power,
 >   Talon and tush and claw.
 > Oh, hear the call!—Good hunting all
 >   That keep the Jungle Law!
 > Night-Song in the Jungle

It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. "Augrh!" said Father Wolf. "It is time to hunt again." He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: "Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world."

It was the jackal—Tabaqui, the Dish-licker—and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee—the madness—and run.

# Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack

>  As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
>    Once, twice and again!
>  And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up
>    From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.
>  This I, scouting alone, beheld,
>    Once, twice and again!
